In the PCA approach, which was mainly developed by my friend Gustavo Trigos, we use the S&P500 historical data. 

From daily returns, we find a correlation matrix that contains the correlations between each stock and all the others. 

From these correlations, we find eigen vectors. There are as many eigenvectors as there are stocks in the S&P500. 
These eigen vectors are mathematically creating a basis, a frame of reference. 
Each eigenvector has a corresponding eigenvalue that indicate us how good is that eigenvector in representing the data,
mathematically how much variance is explained by that vector. 

One can see eigenvectors as directions. 
The direction that represents the most data is therefore the direction or trend followed by most stocks. 
That eigenvector is the one with the highest eigenvalue (the most representative of our data). 

By using eigenvectors with low eigenvalues, we chose a direction that our market (S&P500) DOESN'T follow. 
The logic is that these eigenvectors are axis that we will use to represent our data, 
and that these axis don't explain most of our variance, therefore don't represent our market well. 

Following these directions means following directions uncorrelated to the market.
